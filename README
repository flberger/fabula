About

Fabula is an Open Source Python Game Engine suitable for adventure, role-playing 
and strategy games and digital interactive storytelling.

Fabula can be used as a library to develop your own games. As an alternative, 
you can use the Pygame-based graphical editor and the default game engine that 
come with fabula.

Installation
------------

Fabula comes in several release formats. Which one is for you depends on how you 
want to use Fabula.


### I want to run a standard Fabula client or server, or use the visual editor.

Get the *binary release* for your platform, unzip the archive and simply run the 
appropriate *.exe file.


### I want code my own games using Fabula, customising server logic or the client.

Fabula will run in the following software environment:

- Python 3.3.3, available at [https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.3/](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.3/)

- pygame 1.9.2.a0, available at [https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads)

- To build standalone executables: cx_Freeze 4.3.1, available at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-freeze/files/4.3.1/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-freeze/files/4.3.1/)

Then get the *source release*. Fabula uses the Python distutils module.
To install, unzip the archive and run

    python setup.py install

on the command line.
