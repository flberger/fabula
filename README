README for Fabula
=================

About
-----

Fabula is an Open Source Python Game Engine suitable for adventure, role-playing 
and strategy games and digital interactive storytelling.

It offers a client-server architecture, an event-based protocol, multiplayer
and networking capabilites, a multi-threaded server, an abstract, 
visualisation-agnostic model of a game world, an asset manager and a plugin 
system. Gameplay can be recorded and played back. The code is well documented 
and runs on Linux and MS Windows (it should work on OS X, too, but this has
not yet been tested).

Fabula can be used as a library to develop your own games. As an alternative, 
you can use the Pygame-based graphical editor and the default game engine that 
come with fabula.

You can find fabula on the web at http://florian-berger.de/software/fabula
