- multiplayer and networking capabilites
- multi-threaded server
- abstract, visualisation-agnostic model of a game world
- asset manager

  yet been tested).

Fabula can be used as a library to develop your own games. As an alternative, 
you can use the Pygame-based graphical editor and the default game engine that 
come with fabula.

You can find fabula on the web at http://florian-berger.de/en/software/fabula


Prerequisites
-------------
