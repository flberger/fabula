NEWS for Fabula
===============

0.2.0
-----

Released on 11 March 2011.

Refactoring of the client-server connection procedure. The User Interface now 
displays a splash screen and then asks the player for a login and connection 
details. Moved all timing and event queueing from client to server. The default 
condition-response game logic now allows for a tuple of response events. The 
logic is now stored in a plain text file. Lots of improvements in the user 
interface, most prominently captions for entities and implementation of entity 
conversation. Improved support for Entity subclasses. Update to the new 
clickndrag API. Docs update and a lot of fixes and enhancements under the hood.

0.1.0
-----

Released on 13. January 2011.

This is the first alpha release and probably only useful for a sneak peek. The 
API is still likely to change. API docs are included, but end user documentation 
is still missing. The included editor and Pygame engine are still work in 
progress.
